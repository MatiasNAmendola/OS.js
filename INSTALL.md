# Compability:
Tested on these Linux distributions:
* Gentoo Linux
* Ubuntu Linux (Help: https://gist.github.com/andersevenrud/4723377)

# Dependencies:
* _bash_
* _node.js_ 0.8+ with _npm_ and _node-gyp_
* _git_ 1.6+
* _PAM_ development libraries (debian users: see help file above)
* _syslog-ng_
* _sudo_ to use administration utilities
* _pdf2svg_ and _exiftool_ (Optional, for use with PDF applications)

# Installation:
* Set up your GitHub account and SSH key correctly
* Clone repository
  - `git clone --recursive -b node.js git@github.com:andersevenrud/OS.js.git`
* Start installer
  - `./bin/installer --install`
* Create users
  - Add yourself a new user to test with using `./bin/add-user <username>`.
  - OR run `./bin/update-user-template <username>` on already existing users
* Configure settings and environment (optional)
  - Some are noted further down in this file

# Upgrading:
* Run `./bin/installer --update`
* Update user templates with `./bin/update-user-template <username>`
* Restart server/clients

# Running:

## Testing and Development
* Start the client for your user with:
  `node ./client.js 3000 $(whoami)` (Do **not** run as root!)
* Launch browser in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- You will be logged in with your user

### Barebones mode
You can enable this mode to launch OS.js without enabling features
like the desktop and sessions/registry etc. Usefull for developing apps
because of the fast initial loding time.

Enable `BAREBONE_MODE` and launch with [http://localhost:3000?launch=MyApplication](http://localhost:3000?launch=MyApplication)

## As web server
* Start using `node server-web.js` using `forever`, `screen` or similar
* Launch browser in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- You will be asked to log in

## As system service
**Not done in this branch**

See the `osjs-standalone-sources` repository for Linux distro package(s).

* Set `ENV_LOCALHOST` in `config.js`
* Follow documentation in `vendor/linux-standalone/README.md`

# Running with compressed (and cached) resources:
This also disables debugging messages and performs some optimizaions.
Runs a bit faster than normal, but harder to track down bugs.

* Set your compressor of choice in `config.js`
  - _gcc_: Google Closure Compiler (Manual download)
  - _yui_: Yahoo Compressor
* Run `./bin/update-compression` to compress all scripts etc
* Set `ENV_SETUP` to _production_ in `config.js`
* Restart server/clients

## Font cache
You can cache installed system fonts to improve rendering performance in some browsers.
All fonts will be served directly in the CSS scheme as base64 data instead of linking
to a file by URI.

Just run `./bin/update-fontcache` and fonts will be automatically loaded from cache
on demand.

# Choosing Authentication module
The default authentication method is PAM. You can change which module to use
in `config.js` setting `AUTHENTICATION`.

**Included:** `pam`, `dummy` (a dict of username/password)

# Choosing Communication mode
**Not done in this branch**

You can switch between XHR and WebSockets with the `ENV_WEBSOCKETS` setting
in `config.js`.
